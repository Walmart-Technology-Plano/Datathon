    "#### What are Stop Words?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are the common words in a vocabulary which are of little value when considering word frequencies in text. This is because they don't provide much useful information about what the sentence is telling the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: _\"the\",\"and\",\"a\",\"are\",\"is\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Corpus?\n",
    "\n",
    "A corpus (plural: corpora) is a large collection of text or documents and can provide useful training data for NLP models. A corpus might be built from transcribed speech or a collection of manuscripts. Each item in a corpus is not necessarily unique and frequency counts of words can assist in uncovering the structure in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every word written in the complete works of Shakespeare\n",
    "2. Every word spoken on BBC Radio channels for the past 30 years "
